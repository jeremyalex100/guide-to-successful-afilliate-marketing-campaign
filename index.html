        <h3>the journey to successful affiliate marketing newbie to expert</h3>
        <p>AS ive said earlier on it(<span class="span">affiliate marketing)</span> deals with promoting other peoples products to customers for a commission on every sale being purchased through your links there's a seller who creates an affiliate program and provides affiliate marketers with a unique link that the affiliates then use to promote the seller's products. The links are unique to each affiliate marketer so it's easy to track who made the sale.

When someone clicks the affiliate link, a cookie is stored on their browser. The cookie lets the seller know who sold the product and lets the affiliate earn a commission even if the person clicking the link decides not to buy right away. Cookies do have an expiration date, so in order to get credit for a sale, the consumer needs to make a purchase before the purchase link expires.</p>
